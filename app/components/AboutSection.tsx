          Hi, I'm Nicolas Soria Gomez. I'm 22 years old and originally from Guatemala, now based in Salt Lake City, Utah. I study computer science and am working toward a software engineering degree. I love learning about AI, backend and frontend development, machine learning, and innovation.

          Outside of tech, I enjoy outdoor activities like biking, running, going to the gym, and hiking. I also love watching movies, reading, and playing board games. I believe in creating things that make a difference and advancing technology while having fun along the way.
